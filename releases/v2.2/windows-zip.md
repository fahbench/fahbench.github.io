Extract the `zip` file. Run fahbench by navigating to the `bin/` directory
and launching `FAHBench-gui.exe` or `FAHBench-cmd.exe` for the graphical
and command-line version, respectively.

If you see an error like "api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll missing",
please make sure you've installed all recommended windows updates or
install the [Windows universal
runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48234)
directly.
